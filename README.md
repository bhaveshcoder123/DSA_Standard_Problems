# Python DSA Problem Solutions 🐍

A collection of my Python solutions to common Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. This repository is a personal log of my learning journey.

## 📝 About This Repo

This is where I keep track of the DSA problems I've solved using Python. The primary goal is to practice, reinforce my understanding, and have a quick reference for myself.

The solutions are typically:
*   Written in Python 3.
*   Focused on clarity and correctness.
*   My own attempts at solving these problems.

---

## 📂 Structure

Currently, the solutions are organized simply:
*   Each problem usually gets its own Python file (e.g., `problem_name.py`).
*   As the collection grows, I might group them into folders based on topics (e.g., `Arrays`, `Strings`, `LinkedLists`).

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  **Browse:** Look through the files to find a problem you're interested in.
2.  **Run a Solution:**
    *   Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
    *   Navigate to the directory containing the file in your terminal.
    *   Run the script using:
        ```bash
        python3 your_problem_file_name.py
        ```
    *   Some files might contain test cases or example usage within them.

## 🛠️ Language
